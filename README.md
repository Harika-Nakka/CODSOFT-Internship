As part of my CodSoft internship, I successfully completed three hands-on Java-based projects, each designed to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented programming, problem-solving, and GUI interaction. The first project was a Number Guessing Game, where I used control flow, random number generation, and user input validation to implement a simple yet engaging CLI-based game. The second project was a Student Grade Calculator, which required collecting marks, calculating averages and grades, and displaying the results with meaningful output logic, reinforcing conditional structures and modular methods. The final project was an ATM Interface, where I simulated ATM functionalities like withdrawal, deposit, and balance checking using object-oriented design and menu-driven interaction, promoting clear class responsibilities and encapsulation. These projects helped me apply core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, classes, methods, exception handling, and encapsulation in real-world scenarios, enhancing both my coding confidence and development workflow.
